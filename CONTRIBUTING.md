## 🏗 Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Modularity**: Keep modules independent and focused
2. **Testability**: Design for easy testing
3. **Extensibility**: Allow for future enhancements
4. **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets
5. **Security**: Follow security best practices

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different migration strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: For progress monitoring
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating migration components
- **Builder Pattern**: For complex configuration objects

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: Test with large datasets
4. **Security Tests**: Test data integrity and security

### Test Data Management
- Use test fixtures for consistent test data
- Clean up test data after each test
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing
- Use realistic data sizes for performance tests

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### API Documentation
```swift
/// Performs database migration from current version to target version
/// - Parameters:
///   - configuration: Migration configuration
///   - progressHandler: Optional progress handler
/// - Returns: Migration result with success status and details
/// - Throws: MigrationError if migration fails
func migrate(
    configuration: MigrationConfiguration,
    progressHandler: ProgressHandler? = nil
) async throws -> MigrationResult
```

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data during migration
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Log security events for audit purposes
- Follow OWASP guidelines for security

### Privacy Compliance
- Respect user privacy in all operations
- Minimize data collection to necessary information
- Provide data deletion capabilities
- Comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations

## 🚀 Release Process

### Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update VERSION file with new version
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- Tag releases in Git

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Version number updated
